1.0-b6 (2007-11-19)
-------------------

o API: Added a NeoService interface that EmbededNeo implements. Left a number
  of methods in EmbeddedNeo for backwards compatibility. They will be removed
  the next release.
o API: Changed relationship types to be dynamic, i.e. created in underlying
  store when they are first used. This means that clients won't have to
  register them with EmbeddedNeo at startup.
o API: The semantics of relationship type equivalence has changed from being
  based strictly on object identity to being based on name() equality.
o API: A a new method isType() has been added to Relatinship. Due to the less
  intuitive ways to check reltype equivalence, it's the prefered way to check
  whether a relationship is of a particular type.
o API: Added convenience methods hasRelationship(...) to Node.
o API: Added a convenience method notStartNode() to TraversalPositions to
  clean up the code (less cumbersome null-checks for edge cases) for evaluator
  implementations.
o Shell: Now detects and lists all available commands dynamically.
o Shell: Integration with Groovy for easy evaluation of Groovy scripts.
o Shell: Now auto-reconnects to server.
o Shell: Polish like cleaner output, filters to ls and bash-style prompt with
  variable expansion.
o Core: Lots of performance tweaks and improvements.
o Core: The internal version of the datastores have been changed. This release
  will transparently upgrade old versions of the store files so there's nothing
  manual involved. But after that, previous releases of Neo won't be able to
  read the store files.
o Core: Testing and robustification on Windows.
o Core: Now fully supports array properties for all primitives and Strings.
