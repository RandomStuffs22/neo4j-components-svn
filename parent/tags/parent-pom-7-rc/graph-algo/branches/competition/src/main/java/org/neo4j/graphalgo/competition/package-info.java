/**
 * The base package for the graph-algo competition!
 *
 * This is the branch for the Neo Technology graph algorithm performance
 * competition. There is no prize, but anyone is welcome to create their
 * own contribution package and join in. The goal is to end up with a good
 * set of graph algorithms with high performance implementations on top of
 * Neo4j. All means are allowed as long as they don't violate any laws.
 * So please peek at your competitors code and make something better.
 * 
 * All entries should be created in a sub-package of this package with the same
 * name as your subversion user name. This package should contain an
 * implementation of {@link CompetitionEntry}.
 * 
 * The classes in this package are common data structures and interfaces for use
 * by all competitors.
