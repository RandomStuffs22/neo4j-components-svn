The graph-algo competition branch

This is the branch for the Neo Technology graph algorithm performance
competition. There is no prize, but anyone is welcome to create their
own contribution package and join in. The goal is to end up with a good
set of graph algorithms with high performance implementations on top of
Neo4j. All means are allowed as long as they don't violate any laws[1].
So please peek at your competitors code and make something better.

[1] Working algorithms that violate the laws of physics are VERY welcome!
