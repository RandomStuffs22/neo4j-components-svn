[2010-02-09] Coding style does not adhere to Neo4j standards
    The Graph Algorithms component was created by an intern in 2008 as
    part of a masters thesis project. It has not been properly refactored
    to fit into the Neo4j ecosystem since then, only had minor bug-fixes.

[2010-02-09] The algorithms are not tuned for large graphs
    Almost all algorithms in this package are written for, tested for,
    and optimized for relatively small graphs (tens-hundreds of thousands of
    nodes with thousands of relationships each[?]).
    As many algorithms as possible should be made to work on much larger graphs
    and where that is not possible, the limitations should be documented.

[2010-03-03] Write tests for org.neo4j.graphalgo.shortestpath.future algos
    We must create tests for these algos since they are under development
    and it'd been good to know when they are ready and working :)
