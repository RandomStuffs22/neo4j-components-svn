-------------

o Added a new shortest path algorithm which is very memory efficient and is
  as close to depth-first search as possible.
o Added an implementation of the A* algorithm for efficient finding of cheapest
  paths between two nodes.
o Added a new implementation of the Dijkstra algorithm which uses the new
  traversal framework.
o Added a PathFinder interface which all algorithms which finds path(s) between
  two nodes implements.
o Recommended and functional algorithms can be reached from the
  GraphAlgoFactory class. It also makes it easier to switch implementations
  when such come along w/o having to update code using graph algo component.
o Added a WeightedPath interface (extends Path) which includes a weight of
  the path. Used for such algorithms as A* and Dijkstra.
o Added a factory for common evaluators (used in f.ex A* and Dijkstra).
o Moved all algorithm implementations to .impl.* package(s) to notify users
  that they are up for change. The prefered way to get hold of algorithms is
  via GraphAlgoFactory.
